Project: COVID-19 Data Analysis
Description:

This project utilizes BigQuery to analyze COVID-19 data from the bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary dataset. The goal is to investigate the relationship between the total number of recovered cases and the average number of active cases for selected countries.

Data Source:

BigQuery Public Dataset: bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary
Methodology:

Query: The query selects the recovered and active columns from the summary table.
Filtering: The query filters the results to include only the specified countries: Spain, Mexico, Columbia, and the United States.
Aggregation: The query groups the results by the recovered column and calculates the average active cases for each group.
Results:

The query will output a table with two columns:

summary.recovered: The total number of recovered cases.
Average_score: The average number of active cases for each value of summary.recovered.
This analysis can provide insights into the progression of COVID-19 in the specified countries and the relationship between recovered cases and active cases.
Additional Considerations:

Data Quality: Ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data in the bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary dataset.
Data Visualization: Consider visualizing the results using tools like Data Studio or Looker to gain deeper insights.
Further Analysis: Explore additional analyses, such as time series analysis or correlation analysis, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data.
